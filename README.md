## Usage

To see how this terminal works you can see all the commands:

* uptrun 'app' - UptRun is a command that opens the app that is from the installs folder.

* write 'any text' - The write command prints out the text that you have specified, nothing too special.

* upt install 'a link containing a zip file that uses the Console or the Terminal ' - This command is really important for installing any apps, Neofetch for Terminux is officially in the app

* cd C:\to\a\directory - This command makes the terminal go to a specific location.
